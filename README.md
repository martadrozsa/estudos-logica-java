### Exercise 1
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

__________

### Exercise 2 
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17

__________

### Exercise 3 

You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell represents number of coins in tha cell.
Assuming we start at matrix[0][0], and can only move right or down, find the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.

For example, in this matrix
0 3 1 1
2 0 0 4
1 5 2 1
The most we can collect is: 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 coins
